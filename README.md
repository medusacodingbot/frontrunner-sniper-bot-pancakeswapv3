## What is Frontrunner ?
Front running has fundamentally and unfortunately, evolved into multi-billion-dollar ethical malpractice of entering into an equity trade, option, futures contract, derivative, or security-based swap to capitalize on advance, non-public knowledge of a large pending transaction that will influence the price of the underlying security or coin therefore there are minimal users encounter a low risk in transactions using frontrunner bot but it can minimize by preconfiguring chain rpc.
